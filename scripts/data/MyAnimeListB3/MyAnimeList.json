Standing on fairly equal ground, these two gradually learn the comfort of living together.\n\r\nTheir relationship progresses from strangers to friends as the days pass. This is a story that may one day lead to love.\n\r\n(Source: MAL News)",

The dragon immediately transforms into a cute, busty, and energetic young girl dressed in a maid outfit, introducing herself as Tooru.\n\r\nIt turns out that the stoic programmer had come across the dragon the previous night on a drunken excursion to the mountains, and since the mythical beast had nowhere else to go, she had offered the creature a place to stay in her home. Thus, Tooru had arrived to cash in on the offer, ready to repay her savior's kindness by working as her personal maidservant. Though deeply regretful of her words and hesitant to follow through on her promise, a mix of guilt and Tooru's incredible dragon abilities convinces Kobayashi to take the girl in.\n\r\nDespite being extremely efficient at her job, the maid's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up horrifying Kobayashi and at times bring more trouble than help. Furthermore, the circumstances behind the dragon's arrival on Earth seem to be much more complicated than at first glance, as Tooru bears some heavy emotions and painful memories. To top it all off, Tooru's presence ends up attracting several other mythical beings to her new home, bringing in a host of eccentric personalities. Although Kobayashi makes her best effort to handle the crazy situation that she has found herself in, nothing has prepared her for this new life with a dragon maid.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Loading up Forest of Savior, the MMO they used to play together, she forms a plan to get back at her ex-boyfriend through an in-person event for the game. In the process, she runs into someone unexpected: Akito Yamada, a gaming legend who just happens to be her guildmate.\n\r\nDesperate for support, Akane ropes the asocial Yamada into helping with her scheme and lending her a shoulder to cry on. The differences between Akane and Yamada soon become apparent as they spend time together, yet they cannot help but notice each other's inner qualities. As the two gain more experience with one another in and out of the game, their tentative acquaintance may level up in a way neither expects.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Maquia has always felt lonely despite being surrounded by her people, as she was orphaned from a young age. She daydreams about the outside world, but dares not travel from her home due to the warnings of the clan's chief.\n\r\nOne day however, the outside world finds her, as the power-hungry kingdom of Mezarte invades her homeland. They already have what is left of the giant dragons, the Renato, under their control, and now their king wishes to add the immortality of the Iorph to his bloodline.\n\r\nThe humans and their Renato ravage the Iorph homeland and kill most of its inhabitants. Caught in the midst of the attack, Maquia is carried off by one of the Renato that has gone berserk. It soon dies, and she is left deserted in a forest far from home, now truly alone save for the cries of a single baby off in the distance. Maquia finds the baby in a destroyed village and decides to raise him as her own, naming him Ariel. Although she knows nothing of the human world, how to raise a child that ages much faster than her, or how to live with the smoldering loneliness inside, she is determined to make it all work somehow.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, with an overwhelming workload and a deadline only days away, the aspiring director struggles with what must be sacrificed in the name of creation.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite sharing Ruri's love of reading, Naomi is afraid to approach her due to her unfriendly nature.\n\r\nOne day, while out on a walk, Naomi witnesses a crimson aurora pierce through the sky for a brief moment before vanishing. Shortly after, he encounters a three-legged crow and a mysterious hooded man, who reveals himself to be Naomi from 10 years in the future, explaining that he has come to change an imminent tragic event that happens to Ruri soon after they start dating. Initially taking his words with a grain of salt, present-day Naomi follows his future self's instructions and starts getting closer to Ruri, determined to save her.

        "synopsis": "With the help of producer Masaya Kaburagi, Aquamarine \"Aqua\" Hoshino and Kana Arima have landed the roles of Touki and Tsurugi in Lala Lai Theatrical Company's stage adaptation of the popular manga series Tokyo Blade. Co-starring with them is Aqua's girlfriend, Akane Kurokawa, who plays Touki's fianc\u00e9e, Princess Saya. Due to the fanbase preferring Tsurugi as Touki's love interest, Saya has made fewer and fewer appearances in the manga, making it difficult for Akane to fully immerse herself in the role. Her struggles are compounded by differences between the play's script and the original work\u2014differences that also frustrate Tokyo Blade's author, Abiko Samejima.\n\r\nAqua, however, is more concerned with his personal goals than he is with the play. He has only one objective in mind: to grow closer to director Toshirou Kindaichi and find out what he knows about Aqua's mother, Ai.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Here, both the wandering knight, Bedivere, and Chaldea\u2019s own expedition find the Sixth Singularity. The residents of this desolate land have been driven from their homes as three opposing powers battle for control of the land.\n\r\nBedivere and company seek the help of the Mountain People to rise up against the Lion King and the Knights of the Round Table and combat their slaughter of innocents. After a deadly struggle and the loss of a dear friend, the group approaches Ozymandias, the Sun King, whose incredible power could help them turn the tables. In the halls of this great pharaoh, they desperately seek an alliance. Ozymandias, however, reveals the Lion King\u2019s plans and refuses to assist in foiling them, instead wishing to protect his own people.\n\r\nShaken to their core by the revelation of the Lion King\u2019s true intentions, Bedivere and the Chaldean expedition decide to mount an attack on Camelot itself, hoping to put an end to the Lion King\u2019s schemes.\n\r\nAt last, the day of the final battle in the Holy City arrives.\n\r\nWhat are the true intentions of the Lion King, who has become so cold-blooded and diabolical?\r\nHow can humanity be saved from a world where ruin has been already promised?\r\nWhat will become of Bedivere after shouldering the burden of a sin that can never be pardoned?\n\r\n(Source: Official Website)",

One hot summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko \"Menma\" Honma, appears and pesters him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but he doesn't really care. After all, Menma already died years ago.\n\r\nAt first, Jinta thinks that he is merely hallucinating due to the summer heat, but he is later on convinced that what he sees truly is the ghost of Menma. Jinta and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest. Re-living their pain and guilt, will they be able to find the strength to help not only Menma move on\u2014but themselves as well?\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, he suddenly finds himself too close to the spotlight when he witnesses his popular classmate Anna Yanami be rejected by her childhood friend in the middle of a family restaurant. \n\r\nWhile Nukumizu wishes he could just forget what he saw and move on, Anna ends up forcefully confiding herself in Nukumizu, lamenting her status as a childhood friend fated to have her beloved stolen. As he becomes dragged into Anna's situation, Nukumizu soon gets caught up in the relationship drama of two more girls: Lemon Yakishio, an outgoing member of the track and field club; and Chika Komari, a shy member of the literature club. Now thrust out of his comfort zone, Nukumizu finds himself a major character in the lives of too many losing heroines. \n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.\n\r\nWhen Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills\u2014notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection. \n\r\nNow, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind.

They might go as far as seeing themselves capable of wielding mystical powers, or maybe even believe themselves to have descended from a fantasy realm. This \"disease\" is known as \"chuunibyou\" and is often the source of some of the most embarrassing moments of a person's life.\n\r\nFor Yuuta Togashi, the scars that his chuunibyou has left behind are still fresh. Having posed as the \"Dark Flame Master\" during his middle school years, he looks back at those times with extreme embarrassment, so much so that he decides to attend a high school far away where nobody will recognize him. Putting his dark history behind him, he longs to live a normal high school life.\n\r\nUnfortunately, he hasn't escaped his past yet: enter Rikka Takanashi, Yuuta's new classmate and self-declared vessel of the \"Wicked Eye.\" As this eccentric young girl crashes into Yuuta's life, his dream of an ordinary, chuunibyou-free life quickly crumbles away. In this hilarious and heartwarming story of a boy who just wants to leave his embarrassing memories behind, the delusions of old are far from a thing of the past.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

That same day, he is presented with a golden opportunity to clear his family's debt: a private tutoring gig for a wealthy family's daughter, with a wage of five times the market price. He accepts the proposal, but is horrified to discover that the client, Itsuki Nakano, is the girl he confronted earlier! \n\r\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to get back on Itsuki's good side, Uesugi finds out that his problems don't end there: Itsuki is actually a quintuplet, so in addition to her, he must also tutor her sisters\u2014Miku, Yotsuba, Nino, and Ichika\u2014who, despite the very real threat of flunking, want nothing to do with a tutor.

Now a second-year high school student and the president of the Manga Research Club, Masamune spends a peaceful existence watching the adventures of the angel Liliel, his favorite character.\n\r\nIn the beginning of the academic year, Masamune\u2019s life is turned upside down when he meets first-year student Ririsa Amano, a passionate cosplay practitioner. Despite Masamune's initial reluctance, the determined young woman manages to convince him to become her personal photographer for the production of a collection dedicated to their common favorite character: Liliel.\n\r\nAs Masamune enthusiastically discovers the world of cosplay and photo editing, he is unexpectedly reunited with his childhood friend Mikari Tachibana, who has become a model in the hope of impressing her beloved upperclassman. Realizing that modeling is not enough to intrigue the hopeless otaku, Mikari decides to join the club and become a cosplayer herself, all to finally have a chance at winning Masamune's heart. However, Masamune's love for fictional characters may not be capable of extending to those who impersonate them.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, this is all about to change due to the revision of the school's most iconic policy, as boys are now able to enroll as well.\n\r\nAt the start of the first semester under this new decree, a mere five boys have been accepted, effectively splitting the student body into a ratio of two hundred girls to one boy. Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Andre, and Jo are quickly cast away without having a chance to make any kind of a first impression. Unable to communicate with their fellow female students, the eager boys set their sights on a far more dangerous task: peeping into the girls' bath!\n\r\nIt is only after their plan is thoroughly decimated by the infamous Underground Student Council that the motley crew find their freedom abruptly taken from them, as they are thrown into the school's prison with the sentence of an entire month as punishment. Thus begins the tale of the boys' harsh lives in Prison School, a righteous struggle that will ultimately test the bonds of friendship and perverted brotherhood.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
